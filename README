This is a script for building binutils/gcc/make/python/etc
on HP-UX 11.31 starting with _bundled_ [ANSI] HP-UX cc
compiler: http://xrgtn.livejournal.com/38254.html

P.S.

Older HP-UX 11.11 used K&R cc compiler, which could be used
for bootstrapping using almost the same initial versions of
binutils/gcc, see http://xrgtn.livejournal.com/29123.html
